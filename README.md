# Hyperskill-Music-Advisor
 Simple music advisor program that interacts with the Spotify API and processes JSON object responses.
 
 //TODO project is still at an early stage, I have to refactor into something closer top the MVC design pattern. I'm also having trouble passing test on the hyperskill platform even though the program works in real interactions with the Spotify API.
 I think it's a problem with my authentication code, I'll have to investigate.

  I've tried to implement the MVC model. The program is working in real world interactions with the spotify API but is still failing HyperSkill tests. 
  
  TODO implement error handling and serialisation of the categories response.
